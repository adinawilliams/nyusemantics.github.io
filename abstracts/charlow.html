<b>Ellipsis really is binding</b><br>

<b>Abstract</b><br>



There's some powerful arguments that ellipsis requires some sort of
interpretive identity between antecedent VPs ('&alpha;') and the ellipses they
license ('&epsilon;') (e.g. Sag 1976). However, in the past 25 years, the
field has converged on the view that simple interpretive identity
<i>cannot</i> be what relates &alpha; and &epsilon; (e.g. Evans 1988);
specifically, the interpretive identity approach under-generates. Coping with
this state of affairs has resulted in a complicated, inherently
non-compositional <i>hybrid</i> characterization of ellipsis licensing which
ensures that &alpha; and &epsilon; have (a) some limited form of syntactic
identity, while at the same time (b) giving rise to a coherent discourse pair
(Rooth 1993). 

But against this hybrid view, ellipsis sites behave essentially like
structureless pro-forms whose reference is supplied via the same general
mechanisms which undergird anaphora resolution (Hardt 1999; Schwarz 2000;
Charlow 2008; 2012). In a slogan: it seems that in some cases &alpha;
<i>binds</i> &epsilon;. Indeed, I'll argue that new data warrant a stronger
conclusion: <i>all</i> ellipsis is binding of &epsilon; by &alpha;; thus
ellipsis resolution is a <i>totally semantic</i> process. Yet ellipsis as
binding seems difficult to square with the arguments that enforcing
interpretive identity between &alpha; and &epsilon; under-generates. Though
this seems like a paradoxical state of affairs, I offer an account on which it
isn't. We can have a purely semantic theory of ellipsis as binding which
covers all the data in a principled way.
