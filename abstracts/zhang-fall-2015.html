      <h1>Comparatives revisited: Downward-entailing differentials do not
        threaten encapsulation theories</h1>
      <h2>Linmin Zhang (NYU)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      We analyze comparative morphemes (e.g., -er, more) as
      intervals that serve as default differentials in comparatives. We
      propose that a comparative sentence encodes an interval subtraction: the
      differential, which is an interval, is the result of subtracting the
      interval representing the position of the comparative standard on a
      scale from the interval representing the position of the comparative
      subject. We show that our analysis has at least two empirical
      advantages. First, it accounts for the semantics of comparatives with
      downward- entailing or non-monotone differentials in a very natural way,
      without making universal quantifiers inside of the than-clause take
      scope over the matrix clause. Second, it makes it possible to give a
      unified account for various uses of comparative morphemes (e.g., their
      use in comparative correlatives). We mainly focus on the first advantage
      in this presentation.
