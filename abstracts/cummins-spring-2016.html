      <h1>Being rational with expressions of number</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
        Numerical expressions in natural language ("n", "more than n", "about n", "at most n", etc.) have been the subject of much recent debate in semantics and pragmatics. From a theoretical standpoint, these constitute a useful testbed for ideas about alternatives in pragmatic reasoning, typicality effects, and modality in semantic representations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practical terms, such expressions are also of interest because they are widely used for conveying high-stakes information. A rich tradition of research has studied how people use such information in decision-making, and this has furnished evidence for irrationalities in human reasoning ("cognitive biases"). However, work on rationality has tended to assume that numerical quantity expressions should receive their (na√Øve) semantic interpretations in reasoning tasks. In this talk, I discuss whether and to what extent the subtleties of pragmatic interpretation of number weigh against the evidence for certain cognitive biases.
