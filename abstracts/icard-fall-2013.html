      <h1>Determining What Follows From What: Two Case Studies</h1>
      <h2>Thomas Icard, Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Part of being a competent speaker of a language is being "properly
      attuned" to logical relations between sentences in the language. A
      question of foundational interest in semantics is: Which logical
      relations are relevant to the study of linguistic meaning, and how
      should they be characterized?  Furthermore, what does it mean to be
      "properly attuned" to such relations? I will present two case studies
      based on my recent work that bear on these questions: the first on so
      called probability operators such as 'probably' and 'at least as likely
      as'; the second on "surface level" inference patterns that are easily
      detectable and closely associated with grammatical phenomena.
      Connections to psychology of reasoning and computational linguistics
      will also be discussed.
