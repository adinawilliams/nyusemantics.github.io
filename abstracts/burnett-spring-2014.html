      <h1>Diachronic Investigations into Compositional Semantics: The Rise and
        Fall of Resultative Secondary Predication Constructions in the History
        of French

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      This talk outlines a new research program that investigates the contributions
      that studies of linguistic microvariation (i.e. variation between closely
      related varieties of a single language) can make to linguistic theory, and, in
      particular, to the construction of theories of the semantic module of the
      grammar and the syntax-semantics interface. Since the 1960s, studies of
      dialectal, historical and sociolinguistic variation have made enormous
      empirical contributions to theories of the phonological and morphological
      components of the grammar; however, it is only relatively recently that
      syntactic microvariation phenomena have entered the domain of study of
      theoretical linguistics (cf. Vinet &amp; Roberge (1989), Kroch (1989), Kayne
      (1996), among others). Furthermore, as observed by von Fintel and Matthewson
      (2008), up to this point, studies of dialectal, historical or sociolinguistic
      variation have not played a large role in the construction of formal semantic
      theories. Therefore, the main goal of the research program is to exploit the
      (as yet largely untapped) resource that are variation studies with the aim of
      advancing semantic theory. As a concrete illustration of this methodology, I
      present a diachronic study of the evolution of resultative secondary
      predication constructions (ex. to hammer the metal flat, or to float under the
      bridge (directional interpretation)) from Latin to Modern French, with a
      particular focus on the resultative system of Old and Middle French (11-14th
      centuries). I show how, using a series of quantitative corpus-based diachronic
      studies, we can test the predictions of current analyses in the theoretical
      literature concerning the compositional semantics and typological distribution
      of resultative constructions and, in doing so, arrive at a better
      understanding of the grammatical foundations of causal and telic
      interpretations in natural language.
