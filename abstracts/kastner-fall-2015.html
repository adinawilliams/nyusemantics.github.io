      <h1>Reciprocals reciprocalize themselves but reflexives reflexivize each
        other</h1>
      <h2>Itamar Kastner (NYU)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      The verbal system of Modern Hebrew consists of seven distinct verbal
      "templates": specific morphophonological patterns of affixes and vowels
      which, on combining with a lexical "root" made up of consonants, result
      in verbal forms. This kind of non-concatenative morphology obscures the
      hierarchical arrangement of whichever syntactic, semantic and
      phonological primitives are involved; the affixes are all fused and
      superimposed one atop another, in a manner of speaking.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      This talk focuses on the <i>hitXaYeZ</i> template (where X-Y-Z are the
      root consonants), the only one of the seven templates in which reflexive
      and reciprocal verbs can appear (save for two intriguing
      counterexamples, which I will discuss as well). The question is what is
      special about the morphosemantic structure of this template and how this
      structure interacts with the root. The overall goal is to arrive at a
      compositional semantics for complex verbal forms in Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, the root &radic;rxc has to do with washing; in the
      <i>hitXaYeZ</i> template, <i>hitraxec</i> means 'showered' or 'bathed'
      ("washed oneself"). This is a reflexive interpretation. But for the
      "writing"-related root &radic;ktv, <i>hitkatev</i> does not mean 'wrote
      himself'. Instead, a reciprocal verb arises, 'corresponded with'. On the
      one hand, the lexical semantic content of the root constrains the
      argument structure of the resulting verb. On the other hand, there must
      be something special about the <i>hitXaYeZ</i> template itself since it
      is the only one of the seven that derives reflexives and reciprocals.
      </p>
      <p>
      I will discuss what this tension can tell us about the grammar of
      reflexivity, reciprocality and agentivity crosslinguistically. Time
      permitting, I will also review a recent approach to the morphosemantics
      of reflexives in Greek (Spathas et al 2015) and discuss whether it is
      applicable to the case at hand.
