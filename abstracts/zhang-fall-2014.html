      <h1>Decomposing English 'and' and 'or'</h1>
      <h2>Linmin Zhang, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      English and and or are traditionally analyzed as boolean operators \sqcap and \sqcup (von Stechow 1974, Gazdar 1980, Partee & Rooth 1983, Champollion 2013, 2014); in some studies, and is analyzed as a sum operator \oplus (Krifka 1990, Heycock & Zamparelli 2005).

There are a few issues with these analyses. 

First, how to account for A, B and C? If a silent and is assumed between A and B, one would have to rule out such ill-formed expressions as A and/or B, C and A, B, C by stipulating that and/or can be freely omitted except in its last application, where the semantic scope of the operator \sqcap/\sqcup/\oplus is marked. However, as far as the types of and/or are of the form \type{\tau, \tau\tau} and the two arguments of and/or are of the same type, such a stipulation cannot help over-generating such ill-formed expressions as [[Al and Bill] and [Cal and Jo]] smiled.

Second, as Winter 2006 points out,  Simon and Garfunkel and Dylan each sang a song. is ambiguous between two readings -- a `2 songs' reading (i.e., the duo Simon and Garfunkel and the singer Dylan each sang a song) and a `3 songs' reading (i.e., each of the three sang a song), but the `2 songs' reading is missing inSimon, Garfunkel and Dylan each sang a song. This contrast suggests that in the second sentence, there is no silent and between Simon and Garfunkel.

Third, another problem is how to give a unified account for and. Intuitively, John and Mary is not ambiguous itself; it would rather be the predicate (e.g., smiled vs. met) that determines whether John and Mary should be interpreted as a sum or an intersection. 

Fourth, the current analyses could not account for some other interesting data, such as By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1. (from Web search). This sentence suggests that the items connected by and could be the same, and sometimes the order between the items matters.

My proposal is based on 4 existant ideas: 

1. A finer-grained analysis is needed to decompose the contribution of and/or (Winter 1995, 1998; Szabolcsi 2013, 2014). 

2. In the analysis of A, B and C, the syntactic structure should be nested ([[A, B] C]), but the semantic interpretation should be flat ([A, B, C]) (Winter 2006). 

3. The data type `list' is used in programming languages (e.g., Haskell): `[\alpha]' stands for the type of a list composed of items of type \alpha. 

4. There is a well-observed connection between the use of and/or and the quantifiers \forall /\exists. 

Here I propose a decompositional analysis for and and or: 

(a) silent operator \dag, which concatenates items of type \alpha into a list, 
(b) silent operators \veebar and \barwedge, which filter a list in a deterministic way or an indeterministic way
(b) silent operator f, which takes a sum operator or an intersective operator from the context as one of this operator's argument and folds the list back into an element of type \alpha. 

The combination `f\fint . \barwedge . \dag' is spelt out as and, and the combination `f\fint. \veebar .\dag' as or.
