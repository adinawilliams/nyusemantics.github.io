<b>ASL Loci: Variables or Features?</b><br>

<b>Jeremy Kuhn, NYU</b><br><br>

<b>Abstract</b><br>

<p>
American Sign Language famously disambiguates pronoun antecedents with the use
of space. In ASL, both referential and quantificational DPs (e.g. <i>Bill</i>
or <i>every boy</i>) can be signed at different locations ('loci') in the
signing space. Pronouns can later retrieve these DPs by pointing at the same
locus. Many analyses of ASL pronouns assume that these spatial loci are the
overt realization of formal variables (Lillo-Martin and Klima 1990, a.o.).
This assumption arises from the observation that there are arbitrarily many
loci and that pronoun ambiguity can be resolved under multiple levels of
embedding, mirroring the use of indices in formal systems. On the other hand,
the necessity of formal variables has been contested in semantic theory; in
particular, Jacobson (1999) argues for a Variable Free Semantics, grounded on
the observation that variables are not logically necessary for expressive
purposes.

<p>
I present two arguments that suggest that loci should not be analyzed as
variables, but rather as morphosyntactic features (as in, e.g., Neidle et al.
2000). First, I observe two cases in which ASL appears insensitive to
accidental variable capture. I suggest that this favors a system in which
features can prevent things from being coreferential, but where syntactically
independent choices canâ€™t force two pronouns to co-refer. Second, I show that
loci may remain uninterpreted in certain environments (specifically, in
ellipsis and under focus sensitive operators), akin to person and gender
features in spoken language. Finally, I will discuss data from a few areas
that will dictate further development of the proposal, including "default"
loci and cross-sentential uses of pronouns.
