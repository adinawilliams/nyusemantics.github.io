      <h1>Attitude reports and the semantics of be and same</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In this talk, I present new empirical data showing that the expression
      of the sameness relation (with the use of, for example, symmetric be
      (see also Cumming 2008, Percus &amp; Sharvit 2014), internal
      <i>same</i>, etc) in <i>de dicto</i> attitude reports correlates with
      the absence of corresponding <i>de re</i> attitude reports. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Based on this, I propose a new characterization for the semantics of
      sameness expressions in natural languages: essentially, such sentences
      as 'A is B (and B is A)' or 'A and B are the same' mean that the
      contextually salient properties of the res named A in a certain world
      hold for the res named B and vice versa. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The current proposal can very naturally account for (i) the behavior of
      sameness expressions in attitude reports, (ii) the scope taking behavior
      of internal <i>same</i> (see also Barker 2007), and (iii) the island
      effects of internal <i>same</i> (see also Hardt and Mikkelsen 2014).
      Moreover, the current analysis makes an interesting new prediction: the
      sameness relation expressed in natural languages is not transitive.
