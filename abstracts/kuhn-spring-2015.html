      <h1>Meaning in space: singulars, plurals, and functions in American Sign
        Language</h1>
      <h2>Jeremy Kuhn, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Sign languages, by virtue of their visuospatial modality, can
      communicate meaning through the use of literally another dimension, and
      one, moreover, which has a very intuitive connection to the way that we
      perceive objects and events around us. What this means for the
      linguistic system is that there are places where semantic objects that
      have been postulated on indirect evidence in spoken language can be seen
      in a phonologically overt way in sign language. In this talk, I will
      focus on two case studies in American Sign Language.

      <p class="view">
      First, I look at the case of singular pronouns, where ASL famously
      disambiguates antecedents with the use of space: NPs are placed at
      locations ('loci') in the signing space, and pronouns retrieve these NPs
      by pointing at the same locus. Many analyses of ASL pronouns assume that
      these spatial loci are the overt realization of formal variables
      (Lillo-Martin and Klima 1990, a.o.). I argue that loci should not be
      analyzed as variables, but rather in a manner akin to morphosyntactic
      features. First, I show that the variable-based analysis
      under-generates: it is possible for two loci-sharing pronouns to appear
      free in the same expression but nevertheless receive different
      interpretations. Second, I show that loci share certain important
      properties with morphosyntactic features, including their behavior under
      focus-sensitive operators. These results directly bear on the theory of
      Variable-Free Semantics (Jacobson 1999), which posits that the logic
      underlying natural language does not make use of formal variables.

      Second, I turn to plural reference and functional reference ("Three boys
      each saw a girl. They each waved to her."). As singulars are indexed at
      points in space, plurals are indexed over areas of space, realized in
      one of two ways: either by a sweeping "arc" movement over the area or
      with a reduplicated motion across the area. Plural morphology appears
      cross-categorially, including on pronouns, numerals, and adjectives. I
      show that functional dependence is systematically realized by the
      spatial association of two plurals: one plural provides the domain of
      the function and the other the range. This spatial representation of
      functions allows dependencies to be overtly realized. I discuss
      dependent numerals and the adjectives SAME and DIFFERENT.
