      <h1>Modified numerals revisited: the cases of <i>fewer than 4</i> and <i>between 4 and 8</i></h1>
      <h2>Linmin Zhang (NYU)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          As shown in previous studies (e.g., Spector 2014, Buccola 2015a, b, Buccola and Spector 2015), (i) when non-monotone-increasing numerals such as <i>fewer than 4</i> are used along with distributive predicates (e.g., <i>fewer than 4 students smiled</i>), there is an upper-bound reading, but no existential reading, while (ii) when these numerals are used along with collective predicates (e.g., <i>fewer than 4 students lifted the piano together</i>), there is an existential reading, but no upper-bound reading. I argue that maximality-based pragmatic accounts for these data (Spector 2014, Buccola 2015a, b, Buccola and Spector 2015) are problematic: they over-generate unattested readings in the use of <i>fewer than 4</i> and cannot be extended to account for similar patterns in the use of <i>few</i>/<i>little</i> (see Solt 2007). Following Solt 2006â€™s decompositional account for few, I propose that, essentially, <i>fewer than 4</i> is decomposed into (i) a positive cardinality predicate and (ii) a negation operator which takes the widest possible scope. Sentences with collective predicates are accounted for with an existential closure at the DP level.
