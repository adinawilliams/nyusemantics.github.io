      <h1>Gradable modality: Putting degrees in the ordering source</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Portner &amp; Rubinstein (2014) offer a compelling account of gradable
      modal expressions (e.g. <i>important</i>) that folds together a
      Kratzerian approach to modality (Kratzer 1981) with a degree-semantic
      theory of gradable adjectives. In this talk, I will show that Portner
      &amp; Rubinstein's theory has two notable problems: a) it predicts
      rampant incommensurability effects where they do not occur, and b) as
      they themselves observe, it cannot readily handle cases of equally
      important but incompatible goals, such as (1).

        It is as important to preserve the wetlands as it is to build the new
        housing (which would drain the wetlands).

      <p class="view">
      I propose an analysis of gradable modality that resolves these issues
      while retaining the conservative Kratzerian sensibilities of Portner
      &amp; Rubinstein's analysis. This is accomplished by adding a degree
      argument to the ordering source, making it a context-sensitive function
      from worlds and degrees to sets of propositions. At each degree-level,
      the ordering source orders worlds just like in Kratzer's theory.
      However, a mechanism is built into gradable modals that allows orderings
      from higher degrees to "trickle down" to lower degrees, in a fashion
      similar to von Fintel &amp; Iatridou's (2008) treatment of weak
      necessity modals. The flexibility afforded by this approach avoids
      predicting such fine-grained incommensurability effects as Portner &amp;
      Rubinstein's theory; it also permits an analysis of (1), since nothing
      prevents the ordering source from being different for preserve the
      wetlands (e.g. in view of environmental priorities) and build the new
      housing (e.g. in view of financial concerns).
