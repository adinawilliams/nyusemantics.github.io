      <h1>Universal quantification as iterated conjunction</h1>
      <h2>Dylan Bumford, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      I analyze distributive universal quantifiers like ‘each’ and ‘every’ in
      terms of iterated dynamic update. I argue that this minor adjustment to
      standard dynamic frameworks has at least two empirical advantages.
      First, because information flows forward through the universal
      computation, anaphoric elements can be interpreted
      “quantifier-internally” (Brasoveanu 2011). Second, because dynamic
      conjunction is just relation composition over input and output
      structures, the emerging representations are in a sort of disjunctive
      normal form that facilitates “functional” readings of indefinites.
      Following Solomon (2011), I suggest that these two phenomena are closely
      related, and argue that we should see them both as side effects of
      incremental update.
