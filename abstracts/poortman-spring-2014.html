      <h1>Typicality Effects and Plural Predication</h1>
      <h2>Eva Poortman, Utrecht University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Plural sentences with conjunctive predicates often receive a
      ‘non-boolean’ interpretation. E.g. the men are swimming and crawling is
      interpreted as true when only some of the men are swimming, and the rest
      of them are crawling (Krifka 1990). However, whether this kind of
      interpretation indicates a general non-boolean reading of conjunction
      remains unclear, since as often as not, the interpretation of such a
      sentence is strictly ‘boolean’ (cf. the men are swimming and smiling). A
      challenge for the semantics of plurals is to account for these different
      interpretations, in which properties are distributed differently over
      individual men. Winter (2001) extends the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis
      of Dalrymple et al. (1998), which was initially proposed to account for
      the varying logical interpretations of reciprocal sentences. According
      to Winter’s proposal, a plural sentence with predicate conjunction
      receives a strong, boolean interpretation unless this contradicts
      properties of the complex predicate, which results in a weaker
      interpretation. 
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      I challenge this prediction by showing experimentally that for a large
      set of sentences, there is a continuum of acceptability values for
      non-boolean interpretations. I account for this continuum with a
      principle that predicts how language users apply predicates to plural
      subjects, resolving vagueness systematically. For any given pair of
      predicates, the principle predicts the divergence from a boolean
      interpretation based on the typicality structure of the complex
      predicate: the less typical the complex predicate is considered to be in
      a boolean interpretation, the weaker the interpretation of the sentence
      becomes. 
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      I will discuss this work in parallel to previous experimental work on
      reciprocal sentences, to which a similar reasoning applies. These
      results combined imply sensitivity to the conceptual structure of
      predicates as a basic mechanism of resolving the vagueness of
      distributive quantification with plural predication.
