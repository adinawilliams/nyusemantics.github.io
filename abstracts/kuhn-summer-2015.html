      <h1>Dependent indefinites in dynamic plural logic</h1>
      <h2>Jeremy Kuhn, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Dependent indefinites/numerals are morphologically inflected
      indefinites/numerals that are required to vary with respect to another
      plural or distributive operator in the sentence. (Telugu: 'Every boy saw
      two-two monkeys' means that there are two monkeys per boy.) Recent
      analyses have formalized this constraint within the framework of Dynamic
      Plural Logic (DPlL), a variant of dynamic semantics that is able to
      manipulate and refer to plurals and dependencies (van den Berg 1996,
      Nouwen 2003, Brasoveanu 2008, Henderson 2014, Champollion 2014).
      However, there are many choice points in the formulation of DPlL; these
      differences are perhaps most evident in the different ways in which
      cumulative readings are analyzed. 
      </p>

      <p class="view">
      I will discuss these differences, including predictions for conjoined
      cumulative/distributive sentences ('My friends ordered two appetizers to
      share and one main dish each'). I will propose an analysis of dependent
      indefinites that follows Henderson 2014 in distinguishing two levels of
      plurality ('domain level' and 'evaluation level'). However, I depart
      from Henderson 2014 by defining these levels with respect to another
      argument in the sentence (the licensor). This simplifies the semantic
      architecture in some ways, but requires dependent indefinites to be
      semantically linked to their licensor. I argue that spatial agreement in
      ASL provides overt evidence for this anaphoric link.
