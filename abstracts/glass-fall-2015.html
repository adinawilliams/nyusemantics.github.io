      <h1>A foray into the lexical semantics of distributivity</h1>
      <h2>Lelia Glass (Stanford)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Some predicates are inherently distributive on their subject argument,
      such as <i>laugh</i>: when we know that Ana and Bob laughed, we know that Ana
      laughed, and that Bob laughed. This sort of distributivity inference is
      usually tied to lexical semantics of <i>laugh</i> (Scha 1981, Link 1983,
      Roberts 1987, Champollion 2014, de Vries 2015). But which verbal
      predicates are inherently distributive in this way, which ones are not,
      and why? As a preliminary step towards systematically investigating the
      lexical semantics of verbal distributivity, this talk observes two
      puzzles.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      Looking at the <b>first puzzle</b>, we observe that VPs built from
      intransitive verbs (like <i>laugh</i>) are overwhelmingly distributive
      on their subject argument, whereas VPs built from transitive verbs
      (<i>build a raft</i>) are much more likely to have a collective
      interpretation available (<i>Ana and Bob built a raft - together</i> ).
      Moreover, among transitive VPs, it is unclear which ones will have a
      collective interpretation available and which ones will not. All of
      these patterns call for explanation.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      Turning to the <b>second puzzle</b>, we observe that (a)telicity and
      (non)distributivity are not related in a straightforward way, in that
      {telic, atelic} and {collective, distributive, both} predicates can be
      found in any combination; however, we also observe that atelic VPs often
      <em>favor</em> exclusively distributive interpretations (the atelic
      predicate <i>Ana and Bob ate applesauce</i> can only be distributive),
      whereas telic VPs often <em>favor</em> optionally collective
      interpretations (the telic predicate <i>Ana and Bob ate an apple</i> can
      be distributive <em>or</em> collective).
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      These puzzles are deeply related (Champollion 2010), in that both
      telicity and distributivity engage the question of <em>how much
        participation in a VP event counts as having VPâ€™d yourself</em>? In
      other words, for which VPs can Ana participate in an "Ana and Bob VP"
      event without the VP being separately true of Ana? As a partial solution
      to these puzzles, <b>I propose that</b> VPs describing a scalar change
      realized on an object can have both a distributive and a collective
      interpretation available because it is possible for one atom (e.g.
      <i>Ana</i>) of a multipart subject (<i>Ana and Bob</i>) to help to move
      the object along the scale without fully doing so independently,
      allowing for an interpretation where Ana and Bob brought about the event
      together but not separately. In contrast, intransitive VPs do not
      involve subjects realizing a change on an object; instead, it is the
      <em>subject</em> that is directly undergoing the change described by the
      VP, so there is no way for a member of the subject (such as <i>Ana</i>)
      to help to bring about the event without directly participating in it
      enough for the VP to be separately true of her.
