<b>A Single-Type Semantics for Natural Language</b><br>

<b>Abstract</b><br>

In (Montague, 1970a), Montague defines a formal theory of linguistic meaning
which interprets a small fragment of English through the use of two basic types
of objects: individuals and propositions. In this talk, I develop a comparable
semantic theory which only uses <strong>one</strong> basic type of object
(hence, "single-type semantics"). Such a semantics has been suggested by Partee
(2006) as a 'minimality test' for the Montagovian type system, which challenges
the need for a fundamentally bi-partitioned semantic ontology. The resulting
semantics captures the propositional interpretation of proper names, unifies
Montague's semantic ontology, and yields insights into the apparatus of types
in formal semantics.
