      <h1>A problem about preference</h1>
      <h2>Thony Gillies (Rutgers)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
        This paper is an advertisement for a problem. Preference -- what is
        better than what -- is (somehow) tied to what we hafta do and so
        (somehow) to obligation-describing language. But sometimes our
        predicaments are less specific -- more chunky -- than any preference
        relation could be. Even in such predicaments our obligation-describing
        language isn't murky: there are clear facts about what we hafta do.
        And so we need to understand chunky preference in a way that plays
        nice with our obligation-describing language. But here's the problem:
        (i) the easy answer (roughly: steal from the mushy credence crowd)
        won't work, (ii) probing why suggests a natural constraint that leads
        us straight into a theorem (following from a version of Arrow's
        theorem) that says that only the most un-chunky preferences can
        matter, but (iii) any picture like that is at odds with our
        obligation-describing language.
