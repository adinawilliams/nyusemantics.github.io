      <h1><i>Only</i> and association with negative antonyms</h1>
      <h2>Sam Alxatib, CUNY</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      A problem is detected in how <i>only</i>, traditionally viewed, associates with
      Negative Antonyms (NAs) like <i>(very) few</i>, and <i>rarely</i>, e.g. (1).
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-top: -1.5em;">
          <li>John only attended [very few]<sub>F</sub> meetings.</li>
          <li>John only rarely<sub>F</sub> visits his grandmother.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="view">
      The predicted meanings, which negate the stronger alternatives of the
      relevant NAs, is shown to be incorrect. The attested meanings are shown
      to be truth-conditionally equivalent to the result of removing
      <i>only</i>, hence giving the illusion that only is vacuous. It is
      further observed that, given an NA, sentences where only appears to be
      vacuous become ungrammatical when the NA is replaced with its positive
      counterpart, e.g.
      </p>

      <ol start="2">
        <li>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-top: -1.5em;">
          <li>?? John only attended [very many]<sub>F</sub> meetings.</li>
          <li>?? John only frequently<sub>F</sub> visits his grandmother.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="view">
      I argue for a view that relates the two phenomena: the ungrammaticality
      of the <i>only</i>-positive cases (2) explains the unavailability of
      the predicted meanings in <i>only</i>-negative cases (1). The attested
      readings for the negatives, where only appears to be vacuous, is derived
      from LFs that feature a silent existential quantifier above the NA.
      Though the approach is shown to have technical shortcomings, it
      correctly accounts for the behavioral difference between NAs and their
      positive counterparts.
