      <h1>Plurality effects with embedded questions and exhaustive readings</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Questions are known to behave like plural nouns. Most famously, Berman
      (1991) showed that embedded questions can be modified by adverbs of
      quantity such as 'mostly' or 'in part' (quantificational variability
      effect). They also give rise to so-called semi-distributive readings
      (Lahiri, 2002), and homogeneity effects (observed but never
      implemented). Recently, it has also been shown that questions embedded
      under verbs like 'know' are ambiguous between weak, strong and
      intermediate readings. This ambiguity is usually seen as an orthogonal
      issue, and most recent literature on the various levels of exhaustivity
      completely ignores plurality effects. Here I show how an updated version
      of Lahiri's (2002) proposal can be combined with ideas from Klinedinst
      &amp; Rothschild (2011) to yield a theory of strong and intermediate
      readings compatible with recent theories of plurality effects of
      definite plurals (e.g., homogeneity, cumulative readings). Along the
      way, we will discuss a few puzzles such as mention-some questions,
      emotive-factive verbs ('surprise') and the reason why 'believe' does not
      (usually) embed questions.
