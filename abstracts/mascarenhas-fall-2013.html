      <h1>Interpreting the conjunction fallacy</h1>
      <h2>Salvador Mascarenhas, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In a seminal paper in 1983, Tversky and Kahneman showed that, with certain
      choices of content, human reasoners will consider a statement of the shape 'A
      and B' to be more probable than 'A'. According to probability theory, this is
      a fallacy, for the probability of a conjunction of independent propositions
      has to be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of its conjuncts.
      In this talk I present work in progress arguing that the conjunction fallacy
      is no fallacy at all, and can in fact be derived under reasonable assumptions
      about the interpretive processes involved.
