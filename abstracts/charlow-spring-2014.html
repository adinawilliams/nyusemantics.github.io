      <h1>What's exceptional about indefiniteness</h1>
      <h2>Simon Charlow, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Indefinites loom large in linguistic theorizing about scope, binding,
      and even basic architectural issues (e.g. the nature of the
      syntax-semantics interface and what sorts of objects sentences should
      denote). Two properties are especially striking: indefinites can poke
      their heads out of scope islands ('exceptional scope') and semantically
      bind non-maximally interpreted pronouns they don't--and
      can't--syntactically bind ('donkey anaphora'). Yet a unified picture of
      indefiniteness remains elusive. Theories of exceptional scope both over-
      and under- generate and turn out to be incompatible with theories of
      donkey anaphora (and vice versa).

      Against this backdrop, I'll argue that (a) dynamic and
      alternative/inquisitive semantics for indefinites, indefiniteness, and
      disjunction, though in some sense incompatible, are in fact intimately
      connected; (b) the computer science technique of continuations helps us
      bridge the gap and forge a new semantics encompassing both perspectives;
      and (c) this theory offers progress on a number of recalcitrant puzzles,
      and makes a number of novel predictions that are confirmed. Along with
      (exceptional) scope-taking and (dynamic) binding, data will be drawn
      from ellipsis, disjunction, distributivity, and maximal set anaphora.
      I'll argue that the class of exceptional scope-takers coincides with the
      class of externally dynamic operators; in other words, we can read an
      XP's exceptional scope properties off the way it semantically binds
      pro-forms it doesn't syntactically bind (and vice versa).
