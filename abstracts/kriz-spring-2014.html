      <h1>Musings on Homogeneity and Non-Maximality</h1>
      <h2>Manuel Križ, University of Vienna</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Sentences with definite plurals display a property known as 'homogeneity': (1a)
      is true if John read (roughly) all of the books, (1b) is true if he read none
      of the books. If he read half of the books, neither sentence is true.

      <ol>
        <li>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-top: -1.5em;">
          <li>John read the books.</li>
          <li>John didn't read the books.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      They also display 'non-maximality': (1a) may be counted as true even though
      John skipped one book if that doesn't matter very much.
      </p>

      <p class="view">
      I will argue that homogeneity and non-maximality (i.e. tolerance for irrelevant
      exceptions) should be linked, as both of these properties are shared by a
      variety of constructions (plurals, conditionals, generics), and present a
      theory on which non-maximality is a pragmatic phenomenon that arises from the
      interaction of a trivalent semantics with pragmatic principles.
      </p>

      <p class="view">
      A number of welcome empirical predictions of this approach will be explored,
      including some that arise from a more detailed view on what exactly homogeneity
      consists in for various classes of predicates.
