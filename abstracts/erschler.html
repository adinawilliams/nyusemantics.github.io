<b>Deriving clause-internal left periphery</b><br>

<b>David Erschler, T&uuml;bingen</b><br><br>

<b>Abstract</b><br>

<p>
The conventional wisdom has it that a complementizer should occupy a
clause-peripheral position, either on the left or the right edge. Ostensibly,
this is the only option compatible with multiple spellout approaches to
derivation: For a constituent to be labeled as CP, the fragment of structure
needs to have C merged at the top.
</p>

<p>
However, languages are attested where complementizers may occur
clause-internally, at least under some conditions. One way to account for
these data is to assume that the pre-complementizer material gets topicalized,
Danckaert (2012). For instance, in colloquial Russian, any constituent (and
probably any number of constituents) may be topicalized past a complementizer,
but such a word order will be fairly marked. In some languages the situation
appears to be more complex: complementizers may appear either anywhere between
the left edge of the clause and the verb (Georgian, Ossetic), or strictly
preverbally, (Ossetic). Furthermore, wh-words are obligatorily preverbal in
these languages.
</p>

<p>
In my talk, I will discuss theoretical options for analysis of these
phenomena, concentrating on Ossetic data. I argue that, in order to account
for data of this type, one has to allow movement to proceed <i>within</i> a
closed phase. I propose that in the narrow syntax C indeed occupies the
highest position in the clause, and wh-phrases move into its specifiers. I
will compare the potential of two competing accounts for preverbal
complementizers: (a) that C0 with its specifiers is lowered towards the
verbs, and (b) that the material between the verb and C forms a single
prosodic constituent that includes the topic, and undergoes pied-piping. The
movement is driven by the need of the topic to get a specific prosodic
contour, cf the account of Zubizarreta (1998) for prosodically driven focus
fronting, or the approach of Richards (2010) to licensing of wh-movement.
