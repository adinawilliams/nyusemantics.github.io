      <h1>Role shift, iconicity and quotation</h1>
      <h2>Kathryn Davidson, Yale</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In this talk I will compare the iconic representation of other people's
      attitudes via written language quotation and sign language role shift.
      In writing, quotation is traditionally taken to be atomic verbatim
      representations of another's attitude, while sign language role shift
      has been argued to be something different, more integrated into the rest
      of a sentence. I argue that the missing link is spoken language
      "quotation"/direct speech reports, which are much closer to sign
      language role shift in providing a demonstration (Clark and Gerrig 1990,
      Lillo-Martin 1995) and not a verbatim representation. However,
      demonstrations aren't restricted just to attitude reports: one can quite
      easily demonstrate an action, either via co-speech gesture or, as has
      been argued by Zucchi et al. (2012), in sign language classifier
      predicates, and, I will argue, in Action Role shift (Schlenker 2014). In
      particular, I suggest that the same semantics of event modification
      should be used for the iconic demonstrations in quotation, classifiers,
      and role shift, and provide evidence coming from various domains
      including the morphological structure of classifiers and the language of
      bimodal ASL/English bilingual children.
