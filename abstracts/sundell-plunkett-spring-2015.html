      <h1>Metalinguistic Negotiation</h1>
      <h2>Tim Sundell (University of Kentucky) and David Plunkett (Dartmouth
        College)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In a series of recent papers, we have suggested that debates in a large
      number of areas—including topics of significant interest to
      philosophers, and even debates within philosophy—can best be
      characterized as what we call metalinguistic negotiations. Speakers
      involved in a metalinguistic negotiation do not assert conflicting
      contents. Rather, they negotiate how to use their words, which concepts
      to employ, how to set contextual parameters, how to precisify vague
      terms, and similar representational matters. This type of analysis is
      tailor-made for domains like aesthetic and taste discourse, and its
      plausibility seriously undermines central arguments for competing,
      assessment-relative theories in those areas. But the picture can extend
      well beyond domains that are characterized by "faultless disagreement".
      Our choices about which concepts to use, and about which concepts to
      pair with which words, can be loaded with significance, in ways that
      correspond closely to the object-level matters that intuitively are at
      issue in the domains we discuss. The normative significance of our
      representational choices, and the correspondence between those choices
      and our non-representational activities and goals, ensures that
      metalinguistic negotiation can serve as a means for debating issues of
      great practical and even theoretical significance. In this talk, we
      introduce our framework for thinking about this mode of communication,
      and we gesture towards some arguments that it may be very much more
      common than one might think.
