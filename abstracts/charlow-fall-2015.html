      <h1>Monadic dynamic semantics for anaphora</h1>
      <h2>Simon Charlow (Rutgers)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Dynamic semantics has two key components: state and nondeterminism. The
      former allows expressions to introduce discourse referents, and the
      latter allows indefinites to be analyzed as nondeterministic analogs of
      proper names. This talk motivates a picture in which state and
      nondeterminism are analyzed as linguistic side effects, and formalizes
      this in terms of the category-theoretic notion of a monad. In contrast
      with standard dynamic semantics, the semantics I propose is dynamic down
      to the morpheme, has no use for an operation of dynamic conjunction, and
      explains a wide variety of exceptional scope phenomena (encompassing
      both familiar and novel data) without stipulation. Because of the
      inherent modularity of the monadic approach, it is straightforward to
      extend the theory to handle phenomena like conventional implicature (Ã 
      la Potts) and focus. In addition, the monadic perspective suggests a
      fundamental connection between dynamic and static alternatives-based
      analyses of indefinites, while offering a clear accounting of how they
      differ.
