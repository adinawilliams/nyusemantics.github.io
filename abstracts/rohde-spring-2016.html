      <h1>The context of alternatives</h1>
      <h2>Hannah Rohde (Edinburgh)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      The study of pragmatics examines the mechanisms underlying speakers'
      ability to construct meaning in context and hearers' ability to infer
      meaning beyond what a speaker has explicitly said. These abilities are
      taken to depend both on the properties of what is said as well as on
      considerations of what isn't said. In this talk, I present a series of
      psycholinguistic experiments that highlight how the context of
      alternatives provides knowledge that is brought to bear on pragmatic
      inference. The first set of studies asks how one pragmatic phenomenon,
      referential communication, is influenced by properties of competing
      forms. The context of alternatives is shown to guide *how* speakers
      refer (probabilities for choice of referring expression); however, there
      are other coherence-driven cues that capture *who* speakers are likely
      to refer to (prior probabilities over choice of mention). Listeners in
      turn can be understood to combine these probabilities to estimate the
      likely referent of an ambiguous expression, as predicted by a Bayesian
      model of coreference. What is most intriguing about the data is the
      apparent independence of contributions from factors related to message
      meaning (implicit causality, coherence) and those related to message
      form (production cost, information structure). Another domain where
      competing forms guide communication is in the use of focus marking.
      Results from a set of comprehension studies show how focus marking
      evokes alternatives and thereby influences several pragmatic phenomena.
