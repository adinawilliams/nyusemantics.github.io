      <h1>Coordinate distributivity in Russian and other languages</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      I will talk about two types of coordinate constructions in Russian, the
      counterparts of which exist in Greek, Hungarian and possibly other
      languages, that are distinct from ordinary conjunction and disjunction
      in terms of the inferences they trigger, namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        there exist instantiations of the properties introduced by each
        coordinate (the existential inference)
        </li>
        <li>
        the coordinates hold at non-overlapping time intervals/locations or of
        disjoint sets of individuals (the non-overlap inference)
        </li>
        <li>
        the coordinates fully "cover" a contextually salient or explicitly
        provided time interval, location, set of individuals (the coverage
        inference)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      In my attempt to provide a compositional semantics for these
      constructions I will follow the basic intuition that they are
      distributive constructions (CDCs) in which multiple coordinated Shares
      (things that are being distributed) are distributed over a single Key
      (thing that is being distributed over), and I will review two major
      options: analyzing CDCs as essentially disjunctive constructions and as
      essentially conjunctive ones.
