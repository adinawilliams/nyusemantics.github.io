<b>An inquisitive perspective on meaning</b><br>

<b>Ivano Ciardelli, Amsterdam/ILLC</b><br><br>

<b>Abstract</b><br>



The goal of inquisitive semantics is to develop a picture of sentence meaning which encompasses both informative content -- the potential to provide information -- and inquisitive content -- the potential to raise an issue. In this talk I will describe, motivate, and discuss the notion of meaning proposed by this framework.
