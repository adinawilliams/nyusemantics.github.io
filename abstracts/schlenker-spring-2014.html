      <h1>Super Monsters: Role Shift and Context Shift Revisisted</h1>
      <h2>Philippe Schlenker (NYU, CNRS)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In sign language 'Role Shift', the signer can adopt another person's
      perspective to report a propositional attitude (henceforth 'Attitude
      Role Shift') or an action (henceforth 'Action Role Shift', often called
      'Constructed Action'); this is overtly marked by various means, such as
      a rotation of the signer's body and/or eyegaze shift. This operation can
      be analyzed as an overt instantiation of the mechanism of 'context
      shift' postulated for attitude reports in some spoken languages
      (Schlenker 2003, Anand and Nevins 2004, Quer 2005). In the theory of
      indexicals, operators that 'shift the context' are called 'monsters'. We
      argue that Role Shift is a more powerful 'monster' than its spoken
      language monsters: first, it can appear outside of attitude reports;
      second, it has a strong iconic and quotational component that has not
      been described for spoken languagemonsters.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      For Attitude Role Shift, we argue that  our analysis brings new light to
      the typology of context-shifting operations: while some sign languages
      make it possible to 'mix perspectives' under Role Shift (Quer 2005), we
      argue that ASL and LSF obey Anand and Nevins's constraint that
      indexicals should 'shift together'. Still, in ASL and LSF, data from
      Attitude Role Shift alone cannot fully exclude an alternative analysis
      based on quotation without context shift. By contrast, Action Role
      Shift, which has no known counterpart in spoken language, is not
      amenable to a quotational analysis because it is used to describe
      actions that don't involve any speech- or thought-acts. 
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      In the first part of the presentation, we develop a context-shifting
      analysis that applies both to Attitude and to Action Role Shift. In the
      second part of the presentation, we argue that Role Shift has two
      properties that require a special treatment. First, Attitude Role Shift
      has a quotational component which does not follow from a simple
      context-shifting analysis. Second, Action Role Shift has a strong iconic
      component: properties of signs that can be assigned to the reported
      situation (e.g. a happy face) must be so interpreted.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      We argue that both varieties of Role Shift should be analyzed as context
      shift, but with an important addition:  expressions that appear under
      Role Shift should be interpreted maximally iconically, i.e. so as to
      maximize the possibilities of projection between the signs used and the
      situation they make reference to. This accounts both for the quotational
      character of Attitude Role Shift (in this case, maximal iconicity
      reduces to quotation), and for the fact that Action Role Shift has a
      strong iconic component. Finally, this analysis vindicates the view that
      some expressions may be simultaneously used and mentioned/demonstrated,
      as argued for instance in Recanati 2001.
