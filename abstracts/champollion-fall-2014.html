      <h1>The making of stratified reference: On the process of formalizing
        semantic intuitions</h1>
      <h2>Lucas Champollion, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      The repeated process of formalizing an intuition, checking whether the
      formalization works, and improving it as needed, is a routine task for
      experienced formal semanticists. But it can seem frustrating and
      daunting when you are new to it (and I speak from experience). In this
      presentation, I want to highlight my own experience of going through
      many iterations of formalizing the same concept, and how they all didn't
      work except for the last one. From the personal point of view of my
      experience writing a dissertation in formal semantics, I will try to
      extract generalizable take-home messages and offer tentative advice for
      students who are planning to do the same. I will use the example of
      stratified reference, a generalization of several mereology-related
      properties such as divisive reference and the subinterval property that
      plays a central role in the theory of distributivity, aspect, and
      measurement in Champollion (2010, 2014).
