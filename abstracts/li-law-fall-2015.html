      <h1>Alternatives in different dimensions: A case study of focus intervention</h1>
      <h2>Haoze Li (NYU) and Jess Law (Rutgers)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      We propose a novel way of carrying out Beck's (2006) insight that focus
      intervention can be studied in the framework of alternative semantics.
      Our implementation relies on the idea that focus alternatives and
      ordinary alternatives are alternatives along different dimensions. The
      interaction of different types of alternatives gives rise to
      inappropriate quantificational domains of focus-sensitive operators,
      causing focus intervention. 
      </p>
      <p class="view">
      On the empirical front, this approach has updated the generalization of
      focus intervention in two ways. First, focus-sensitive operators are no
      longer taken to be inherent interveners; they become problematic only
      when they take a set of sets of alternatives as its quantificational
      domain. On this view, focus intervention is not actually an intervention
      phenomenon, but a purely quantificational phenomenon. Second, this
      approach allows for a very general understanding of focus intervention,
      providing a unified analysis of focus intervention with interrogative
      <i>wh</i>-phrases, non-interrogative <i>wh</i>-phrases and disjunctive
      phrases. On the theoretical front, this approach makes Alternative
      Semantics a more fascinating theory by recognizing that alternatives
      along different dimensions may interact to give rise to interesting
      grammatical phenomena.
