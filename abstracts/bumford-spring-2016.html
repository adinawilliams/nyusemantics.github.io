      <h1>Split-scope definites: How 'the' can mean two things at once</h1>
      <h2>Dylan Bumford(NYU)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Singular definite descriptions like "the hat" generally only make sense
      in contexts that provide enough information for hearers to deduce which
      object, in this case which hat, the speaker intends to refer to. As a
      result, without relevant preceding discourse such descriptions are
      usually unacceptable unless the context of utterance provides a unique
      potential witness for the description, say, a single salient hat. There
      are, however, systematic exceptions to this. Consider the letters in the
      word "starters", for instance, and imagine I ask you to look at the "the
      't' after the 'r'". Even though "the 'r'" should be incoherent (since
      there are two 'r's), it is clear that "the 't' after the 'r'" refers to
      the second of the two 't's, and thus the first of the two 'r's.
      Similarly, "the book on the shelf" (as opposed to the ones on the
      table), "the woman in the painting" (as opposed to the women in real
      life), and "the guy who threw the beer at the lead singer" (as opposed
      to the guys who didn't throw any beers) may all be felicitous in
      contexts with multiple shelves, multiple paintings, and multiple beers.
      In each example, it is as if the two definite descriptions in fact
      define each other: e.g., the book, y, on a shelf, x, where x is the
      shelf y is on.
      </p>

      In view of examples like these, I argue that definite descriptions are
      interpreted in two steps, and that these two steps don't always happen
      in immediate succession. In the first step, all possible referents for
      the description are collected; in the second, they are counted. If the
      number of potential referents is one, all is well; otherwise, the
      description is ill-formed. What is interesting about the descriptions
      above is that these two processes take effect at different points in the
      respective semantic computations. Technically, I'll say the scopes of
      these definite articles are split. This allows descriptions to interact
      with one another in ways that have not previously been predicted to be
      possible. I'll go on to show that this idea sheds light on an old
      ambiguity in the interpretation of superlatives, and suggest that a
      handful of quantificational adjectives might actually be piggybacking on
      the "delayed" cardinality test of the definite determiner. Finally, I
      step back and demonstrate how we might maintain traditional notions of
      semantic compositionality, according to which words are interpreted in
      one place at one time, in light of the bipartite meaning of 'the'.
