      <h1>An Inquisitive Semantics Treatment of Question Particles</h1>
      <h2>Jeff Lin, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Inquisitive Semantics (AnderBois 2012 and Ciardelli, Gronenendijk, and
      Roelofsen 2012) characterize questions as a proposition that is
      <em>inquisitive</em> and <em>non-informative</em>, and presents three
      closure operators: ?<sub>open</sub>, ?<sub>closed</sub>, and !.  We
      argue that there are exactly three ways that these operators, or
      combinations thereof, can form questions, and that each corresponds to a
      question marked by distinct sentence final Q(uestion)-particle in
      interrogative context, known from the literature on Mandarin Chinese.
      </p>

      <p class="view">
      Specifically, the ?<sub>open</sub> operator forms a possibility out of
      the so far excluded world(s), and adds it to the proposition: ⟦P⟧ ⋃
      ⟦¬P⟧.  Thereby it makes the proposition <em>inquisitive</em> and
      <em>non-informative</em>. We argue this is exactly what the empty
      Chinese Q-particle ∅ does.  Secondly, the ?<sub>closed</sub> operator
      shrinks the presupposed logical space to the worlds already in the
      proposition.  Crucially, this operation cannot turn a
      <em>non-inquisitive</em> proposition into a question. The question
      formed in this way requires the proposition to be <em>inquisitive</em>,
      which corresponds to the Chinese questions marked by sentence final
      'ne'-particle.  Finally, the third closure operator, !, forms
      <em>non-inquisitive</em>proposition by uniting all existing
      possibilities in a single "flat" possibility. Since the result is
      <em>non-inquisitive</em>, ! cannot be the main operation in forming
      questions.  Instead, the result is combined with ?<sub>open</sub>
      operator to form polar questions. We show that this is the case of
      Chinese polar questions marked by 'ma'-particle.
      </p>

      <p class="view">
      In the second half of this talk we will present data of Chinese
      Q-particles in non- interrogative context, and we aim to show that the
      Inquisitive Semantics analysis can capture the semantic/pragmatic
      similarity in the two contexts.
