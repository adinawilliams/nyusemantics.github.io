      <p class="view">
      Recently, there has been a shift away from traditional
      truth-conditional accounts of mean- ing towards non-truth-conditional
      ones, e.g., expressivism, relativism and certain forms of dynamic
      semantics. Fueling this trend is some puzzling behavior of modal
      discourse. One particularly surprising manifestation of such behavior is
      the alleged failure of some of the most entrenched classical rules of
      inference; viz., modus ponens and modus tollens. These revisionary,
      non-truth-conditional accounts tout these failures, and the alleged
      tension be- tween the behavior of modal vocabulary and classical logic,
      as data in support of their departure from tradition, since the
      revisionary semantics invalidate some of these patterns. I, instead,
      offer a semantics for modality with the resources to accommodate the
      puzzling data while preserving classical logic, thus affirming the
      tradition that modals express or- dinary truth-conditional content. My
      account shows that the real lesson of the apparent counterexamples is
      not the one the critics draw, but rather one they missed: namely, that
      there are linguistic mechanisms that affect the interpretation of modal
      language in a con- text in a systematic and precise way, which have to
      be captured by any adequate semantic account of the interaction between
      discourse context and modal vocabulary. The semantic theory I develop
      specifies these mechanisms and captures precisely how they affect the
      in- terpretation of modals in a context, and do so in a way that both
      explains the appearance of the putative counterexamples and preserves
      classical logic.
