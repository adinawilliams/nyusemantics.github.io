      <h1>The Psychological Representation of Modality</h1>
      <h2>Joshua Knobe, Yale</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Work in formal semantics has led to the development of a unified account
      of the semantics of natural language modals, allowing us to understand
      both the role of physical considerations (in circumstantial modals) and
      the role of moral considerations (in deontic modals). I argue that the
      standard semantics for modal expressions actually gives us a glimpse of
      a far more general fact about human cognition. Even when people are not
      explicitly using modal expressions, they can engage in cognitive
      processes that involve operations on representations of possibilities,
      and experimental evidence indicates that these operations are impacted
      by both physical and moral considerations. Drawing on this evidence, I
      argue that the patterns we observe in people's use of natural language
      modals reflect a deeper fact about the way people represent
      possibilities in thought.
